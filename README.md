# data-cleaning
use python to solve data cleaning,  and the original data saved in sql.

Since the data is big, there may be errors:

1.memoryerror.

To solve this problem, you should ensure your python is 64bit.

if there is still a memoryerror, try to read the data one by one.
and i have this error, my python is 64 bit ,too. so i think this error caused by the big data.
 
 if you have any trouble or good idea, please told me: berry000000@sina.com.
 
 2.Since the original data is saved by sql.
 
 first, we need to change sql to .csv or txt.
 
 second, extract the useful column or row.
